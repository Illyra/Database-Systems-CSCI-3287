WHAT IS A DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM?
    >Database is a large, integrated collection of Data
    >Models real-world enterprise
        >Entities(students, course)
        >Relationship (for exdample, Madhuri is teaching CSCI-3287)
    >A Database Management System is a software package designed to software



Types of Database Applications
    >Traditional Applications:
        -Numeric and Textual Databases in Business Applications
    >More Recent Applications:
        -Multimedia Databases (images, video, voices, etc)
        -Geographic informations systems (GIS)
        -Data Warehouses
        -Real-time and Active Databases
        -Many other Applications
    >Initial part of book focuses on traditional Applications
    >A number of recent applicatrions are described later in the book (for example, chapters 26,27,28,29)

Basic Defintions
    >Database:  
        -A collection of related Data
    >Data
        -known facts that can be recorded and have an implicit meaning.
    >Mini-world
        -Some part of the real world about which data is stored in a database.
            for example, student registration, grades, and transcripts at a university
    >Database Management System(DBMS)
        -A software package/system to faciliate the creation and mantienance of a system.

Typical DBMS Functionality
    >Define a particular database in terms of its data types, Structures, and constraints
    >Construct or Load the initial dabase contents on a secondary storage medium (typically hard disk)
    >Manipulating the database:
        -Retrieval : Querying, generating reports
        -Modifications: Insertions, deletions and updates to its contents
        -Accessing/changing the database through Web Applications
    >Processing and Sharing by a set of concurrent users and application programs - yet, keeping all data
        valid and consistent
    >Other features
        -Protection or Security measures to prevent unauthorized Accessing
        -"Active" processing to take internal actions on data
        -Presentation and Visualization of data
        -Maintaining the database and associated programs over the lifetime of the database Applications
            -Called database, software

Examples of database University Applications
    >Mini-world for example:
        -Part of a university environment
    >Some mini-world entitites:
        -students
        -courses
        -Sections (of courses)
        -(academic) DEPARTMENTS
        -Instructors

Main Characteristics of the Database Approach
    >Self describing nature of a database system
        -A DBMS catalag stores the description o f a particular
            database (e.g data structures, types, and constraints)
        -The description is called meta-data
        -This allows the DBMS software to work with different database applications (university, banks, airlines, etc)
    >Insulation between programs and data:
        >Called program-data software
    >Insulation between programs and data
        -accomplished through data abstraction
        -a data model is used to hide storage details and present the user with a conceptual view of the database
